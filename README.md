# SheetTime Beta

## Introduction

### SheetTime (macOS) — Public Beta

SheetTime is a menu-bar–first macOS application that helps you track time with minimal friction and push structured time data directly into Google Sheets.

The goal of SheetTime is **ownership of your data**: no proprietary formats, no locked dashboards—just clean rows in a spreadsheet you already use.

---

### Key Features

* ⏱ Automatic background time tracking
* 📊 Direct sync to Google Sheets
* 🧾 Spreadsheet-native reporting (no exports needed)
* 🧠 Minimal, distraction-free menu bar UI
* 🔐 Local-first design (no mandatory accounts)

---

### Why SheetTime?

Most time trackers lock your data behind dashboards and subscriptions. SheetTime treats **Google Sheets as the source of truth**, making it easy to bill clients, analyze productivity, or build your own reports.

---

### Status

This is a **public beta**.
The app is functional but still evolving based on real-world feedback.

---

### macOS Security Notice (Important)

SheetTime is currently **unsigned** because it is an early beta and not yet enrolled in the Apple Developer Program.

On first launch, macOS may show a warning. To open the app:

1. Drag `SheetTime.app` to Applications
2. Right-click → **Open** → **Open**

This is expected behavior for beta software.
